	<h1> Studying at NFLSBCA <h1>
	<h3> BCA, as it is a famous school, I always have a busy life at school... although the classes are sometimes difficult, but I never stop learning about all the courses although whole semesters are nearly finished.</h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjbeN4"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjbeN4.jpg" alt="gjbeN4.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  <h3> I usually have a good grade at school, but I sometimes fails to balance the studying and video games... I feel that I still need to achieve a better balance in order to prepare for my future life.</h3>
	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjbuC9"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjbuC9.jpg" alt="gjbuC9.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  <p> Study or life? </p>
	<h3> However, I have to mention that my grade is always OK in these three years... although some unbalanced life and internet classes were trying to make it worse, but I still insist and continue to become better. </h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjbZEF"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjbZEF.jpg" alt="gjbZEF.jpg" border="0" /></a>
	<h3> I cannot say what the life will be in my university, but... I would like to say that, the purpose of studying is to make oneself become better and better, so I will never stop learning, never. </h3>
  <h2> A lazy youth, a lousy age.</h2>
    

  <h1> Activities </h1>
	<h2> NFLSBCA is always famous for its various activities, and I actually experience and feel that in my high school. </h2> 
	<h3> I used to be very quiet and shy, but I have changed in some ways when taking the activities in BCA. </h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjvEHx"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjvEHx.jpg" alt="gjvEHx.jpg" border="0" /></a>
	<h3> In Grade 10, I tried to take as many clubs as some Grade 12 students suggest, but then I find my weak personality - I cannot overcome my SHYNESS and FEAR when communicating with others. </h3>
  <h3> But luckily, there are guys that treated me very well in clubs and I really wanted to thank them for taking care of me. They are the ones that firstly contributed to my changes that always continues in these years. </h3>

  <h3> I will also thank the BCA teachers for helping me. They are not only teachers but wise and knowledgeable friends. </h3>

  <h2> Then, in Grade 11 and Grade 12, I did a lot of things I never thought of... </h2>
  <h3> Like running for the Students' Council... </h3>
  <h3> Like being the leader of one club... </h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjv5rR"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjv5rR.jpg" alt="gjv5rR.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  <p> Communicating with the trainer </p>
  <h3> Although some of them failed, but I still got very valuable experiences that might be beneficial to me. </h3>
  <h3> I also understand what to do in the future. I will I could have a brand new life in my university. </h3>

  
  <h1> Conclusion </h1>
  <h1> Colorful Years...? </h1>
	<h3> NFLSBCA really helps me understand a lot of things that I have never thought of before. When growing up, I have to thank the assist from BCA. </h3> 
  <h3> However, there are absolutely more than good memories as there are more serious things that I think deeply into. </h3>
	<h3> I hope I could remember all the good school memories in BCA in the future. </h3>
